<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The companies and clients I have worked for constantly need updated and reimagined website designs to keep their brands fresh and maintain standards across their platforms. This is a summary of the process I have developed and matured over 18 years to create and develop the designs and redesigns.</p>

<h4>Process</h4>
<p>My designs and redesigns process begins with requirements gathering and initial stakeholder meetings. This is to set expectations in terms of what the stakeholders want and the timeline they have to launch. Following these kickoff meetings, depending on if this is a new site or a design, I will complete an information analysis as well as complete audits, focusing specifically on competitor and accessibility.</p>
<p>I like to get feedback early and make sure development is on board early with any major changes.  Skeleton designs will also be used at this stage to explore any potential user flow adjustments to suggest.</p>
<p>After usually a round or two of reviews with the stakeholders, we will finalize designs. On my end, that means document handoff to the developers. I also like to keep in contact with the devs as need through the production.</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Earlier, in my career, I would have been coding out the different templates and components of the sites that needed to be built. So, my participation continued post design since I was the main individual that would build out the designs.</p>

<h4>Problems</h4>
<p>Each project had its unique hurdles and hiccups, from changing business directions to change of stakeholders but the most reoccurring problem was and will likely always be something I call, stakeholder scheduling and commitment phobia. Can the stakeholders keep to their own schedule? </p>
<p>I've have found the best strategy to avoid having designs and products impacted by this is to keep stakeholders included with the designs as much as possible.</p>
<p>Their schedule ultimately is my schedule while we are working together and accommodating and accounting for that allows me to keep projects on time and creative solutions flowing.</p>

<h4>Conclusions & Take Aways</h4>
<p>The process and designs presented here are a small sample of the completed work I have participated in building and improving the web.</p>
<p> I've learned to approach problems with a practical view but know that I can leverage the design process to create innovative and dynamic solutions.</p>
<p>Ive built and designed the framework for six major b2b brands, designed dozens of premier industry events, who would go on to be sold as part of a private corporate acquisition. I designed four business to business corporate media news sites with traffic, each, in the several millions monthly. And recently, finishing up a new Space based site seen here.</p>
