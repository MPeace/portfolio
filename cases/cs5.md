<h4>Background</h4>
<p>As senior web designer at a mid size b2b media company, I led the initiative to investigate our site analytics following a dramatic increase in user traffic.</p>

<h4>Challenges</h4>
<p>Our existing web site analytics needed more sophisticated tracking features to have a better understanding of the traffic patterns the sites were experiencing. Identifying the source of our traffic spike was the largest and most important challenge at this stage of the project.</p>

<h4>Strategy and Approach</h4>
<p>I researched and reviewed web site analytic services and recommended utilizing additional analytics software capable of expanding our analytics insight, specifically leveraging heat mapping. </p>

<p>Heat mapping would capture click frequency after the users landed on our site. We knew most of our traffic was coming in through our newsletter but wanted to know where they were going after first engagement.</p>



<h4>Execution</h4>
<p>After analyzing our heat map tests we identified two core improvements: focus our efforts on the newsletter, elevate the brand experience,  since it was driving over 85% of our traffic, and redesign our header and main navigation to emphasize our newsletter call to action while also reducing the total number of actionable links.</p>

<h4>Results and Metrics</h4>
<p>By reducing the total number of links within the site header we were able to reduce.</p>
<p>Significant increase in leads resulting in improved sales margins helping to position the company for eventual acquisition. This translated into roughly 20% increase in sales contracts leads </p>
