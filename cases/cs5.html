<h4>Background</h4>
<p>I was working with a market forecasting company to update and improve their digital products and marketing site. As part of a post-acquisition integration initiative, we finalized this project in the fall of 2022, streamlining their existing products to integrate effortlessly with established product lines and brand experiences.</p>
<p>However, their products were encountering challenges, specifically, stagnant user growth and engagement.  Identifying the root cause and potentially addressing this issue became critical in light of the merger. </p>
