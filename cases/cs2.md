<h4>Background</h4>
<p>I was working with a market forecasting company to update and improve their digital products and marketing site. As part of a post-acquisition integration initiative, we finalized this project in the fall of 2022, streamlining their existing products to integrate effortlessly with established product lines and brand experiences.</p>
<p>However, their products were encountering challenges, specifically, stagnant user growth and engagement.  Identifying the root cause and potentially addressing this issue became critical in light of the merger. </p>

<h4>The Problem â€” User Expectations</h4>
<p>Our primary objective in undertaking this project was to investigate the reasons behind the stagnation in user growth and engagement. The team conducted a user survey, distributing a concise questionnaire to our existing  user base. The survey aimed to understand why users utilized the product they paid for and their overall satisfaction with it. </p>
<p>The insights gleaned from this survey were invaluable, revealing that users found the product unattractive, challenging to navigate, and outdated in appearance. However, they also expressed a strong appreciation for the valuable data provided by the platform, which motivated them to maintain their memberships. Armed with this information, we were poised to devise a solution.</p>
