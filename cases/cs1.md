<h4>Background</h4>
<p>As senior product designer, working for a B2B media corporation, I lead the initiative to update and enhance the marketing website and digital products for a newly acquired market forecasting company.</p>

<p>User surveys were conducted post acquisition that resulted in the identification of two key areas for improvement within the products.</p>

<h4>Project Objectives</h4>
<p> Analysis from the user surveys showed flat user growth and declining user engagement within the organizationâ€™s most used products. Our primary objective for this initiative was to investigate the cause behind this and solutions to address it.</p>

<p>Additionally, we set out to evolve and improve the design and brand experience to better meet user expectations.</p>

<h4>Strategy / Approach</h4>
<p>The backend code base had many legacy constraints and would place a number of limits on the design. Because of this, the project was split into three phases; paid customer products (?), marketing homepage (redesign?), and finally, a full website. </p>

<h4>Execution</h4>
<p>Analyzed and refined user flows to improve processes and add efficiencies. One instance resulted in a lead capture process going rom five down to two steps.</p>
<p>Components were redesigned to reflect the the new brand experience and increased emphasis on accessibility. </p>
