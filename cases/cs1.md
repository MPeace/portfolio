<h4>Background</h4>
<p>As senior product designer, working for a B2B media corporation, I lead the initiative to update and enhance the marketing website and digital products for a newly acquired market forecasting company.</p>

<p>User surveys were conducted post acquisition that resulted in the identification of two key areas for improvement within the products.</p>

<h4>Project Objectives</h4>
<p> Analysis from the user surveys showed flat user growth and declining user engagement within the organizationâ€™s most used products. Our primary objective for this initiative was to investigate the cause behind this and solutions to address it.</p>

<p>Additionally, we set out to evolve and improve the design and brand experience to better meet user expectations.</p>

<h4>Strategy / Approach</h4>
<p>The backend code base had many legacy constraints and would place a number of limits on the design. Because of this, the project was split into three phases; paid customer products, marketing homepage redesign, and finally, a full website. </p>


<h4>Execution</h4>
<p>Analyzed and refined user flows to improve processes and add efficiencies. One instance resulted in a lead capture process going from five steps, down to two.</p>
<p>In all phases of the project we made it a priority to identified customer funnel improvements and review and update user flows. </p>
<p>Components were redesigned to reflect the the new brand experience and increased emphasis on accessibility. </p>

<h4>Results and Challenges</h4>
<p>User engagement has shown six months of continued improvement</p>
<p>The homepage and website redesign are pending release.</p>
<p>The project was validated when the largest client granted access to the platform for their employee use.</p>
<p>Limited resources and stakeholder priorities caused this project to stall at times. I kept weekly communication with the different stakeholders to maintain project momentum.</p>
