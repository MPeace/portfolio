<p>With these two groups of information completed we could begin working on an initial set of attendees that would be the basis for the continuing work. We held multiple work sessions over a month or so, working with the different events team members. We setup the sessions to be repeatable and uniform so that we could repeat the same process in each interview chat session.</p>
