	<li>Project Completed <span>2023</span></li>
	<li>Project Role <span>UX/UI, User Research, Management</span></li>
</ul>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The companies and clients I have worked for regularly need updated and reimagined product and websites to keep their brands fresh and maintain standards across their platforms.</p>
	
<p>The range of sites that I have designed and developed include, user portfolios, event, media and product sites.</p>

<h4>Process</h4>
<p>Designs and redesigns begin with requirements gathering and initial stakeholder meetings. I set expectations and timelines in these chats.</p>
	
<p>Following kickoff meetings, depending on if this is a new site or a design, I will complete an information analysis as well as complete audits as needed. I lean especially heavy on accessibility because of the additive nature of those improvements. </p>
	
<p>I like to get feedback early and make sure development is on board early with any major changes.  Skeleton designs will also be used at this stage to explore any potential user flow adjustments we might suggest.</p>
	
<p>Finally, designs and design review that moves onto development.</p>




<h4>Strategy / Approach</h4>
<p>Projects ranged in time and scope
	Large scale redesigns with new brands
	Smaller scale site updates</p>

<h4>Execution</h4>
<p></p>

<h4>Results and Metrics</h4>
<p></p>

<h4>Challenges and Solutions</h4>
<p>
Time to build and expectation of client/stakeholder
Projects scope creep - just add this one last little feature
Project abandonment
</p>
<p>
Simplify and then simplify again. 
Iteration and refine are good processes to leverage early on.
Use systems when you can and always build for accessibility
