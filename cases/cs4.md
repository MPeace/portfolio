<h3>A summary of the many designs and redesigns I have completed.</h3>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>As lead designer and sometimes developer, a consistent focus has been in supporting companies and clients to reimagine their products and websites, keeping brands fresh and maintaining standards across platforms.</p>
	
<p>The range of sites that I have designed and developed include event and meetings, media and product sites.</p>

<h4>Process</h4>
<p>Designs and redesigns begin with requirements gathering and initial stakeholder meetings where I set expectations and establish project timelines.</p>

	
<p>Following kickoff meetings, I will complete an assessment of the information architecture as well as conduct audits as needed. I focus heavily on site accessibility due to the additive nature of those improvements.</p>
	
<p>I seek feedback early in the project to ensure development is onboard and supports any major changes.</p>
	
<p>Skeleton designs will also be presented at this stage to explore potential user flow adjustments.</p>

<p>Finally, my goal is to provide clear, concise and complete designs for design review and developer handoff.</p>


<h4>Execution</h4>
<p>Projects ranged in time and scope. Some spanning across multiple quarters to some having just a single sprint to finish a site.</p>

<h4>Results and Metrics</h4>
<p>Millions of users have viewed the sites my designs have been featured on and continue to be viewed today.</p>

<h4>Challenges and Solutions</h4>
<p>Communication was critical to managing stakeholder availability and setting clear goals early in the process helped alleviate most late project requests.</p>
<p>When unexpected requests or problems occurred, I found that taking a systems approach and leveraging accessibility were the most reliable tools to address the problems.</p>
